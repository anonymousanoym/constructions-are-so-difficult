Sentence: The Aequi , however , were so stunned at the Romans ' boldness that they abandoned their camp and fled .\nAnswer: good\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasons why each sentence is acceptable or unacceptable:\n\n1. Acceptable: This sentence is grammatically correct, with a subject (Flos) and a verb (has seen) in the present tense.\n2. Unacceptable: This sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb \"sees\" does not agree with the subject \"Chardon\" in number. \"Chardon\" is a singular noun, so the verb should be in the singular form \"see\" instead of the plural form \"sees.\"\n3. Unacceptable: This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it does not contain a verb. \"Bob\" is a proper noun, but it does not make sense as a sentence on its own without a verb.\n4. Acceptable: This sentence is grammatically correct, with a subject (malevolent floral candy) and a verb (is) in the present tense.\n5. Acceptable: This sentence is grammatically correct, with a subject (the bone) and a verb (chewed) in the past tense.\n6. Unacceptable: This sentence is grammatically incorrect because the subject and verb do not agree in number. \"The bone\" is a singular noun, so the verb should be in the singular form \"chews\" instead of the plural form \"chewed.\"\n7.
