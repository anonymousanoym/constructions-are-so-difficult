Here's a list of the issues:\n\n* \"An hour later\" should be \"An hour later,\" with a comma after \"hour.\"\n* \"they 're\" is a contraction of \"they are,\" but it's not appropriate in this context. The correct phrase would be \"they are.\"\n* \"which\" is a pronoun that refers to a clause, but it's not clear what clause it's referring to in this sentence. It's likely that the writer intended \"who\" instead, which would refer to \"Elijah and Rebekah.\"\n* \"Klaus originated their bloodline\" is a bit awkwardly phrased. It would be clearer to say \"Klaus is their ancestor\" or \"Klaus is the origin of their bloodline.\"\n* \"were sure it was n't\" should be \"were sure it wasn't.\"\n* \"Kol Mikaelson ( Nathaniel Buzolic )\" is a parenthetical", "found_words": ["bad"], "answer": "bad", "gold": "good"}, {"label": "non-causal", "test": "<s>[INST]Now we are going to say which sentences are acceptable (i.e., grammatical) and which are not.\n\n        Sentence: Flosa has often seen Marn.\n        Answer: good\n\n        Sentence: Chardon sees often Kuru.\n        Answer: bad\n\n        Sentence: Bob walk.\n        Answer: bad\n\n        Sentence: Malevolent floral candy is delicious.\n        Answer: good\n\n        Sentence: The bone chewed the dog.\n        Answer: good\n\n        Sentence: The bone dog the chewed.\n        Answer: bad\n\n        Sentence: I wonder you ate how much.\n        Answer: bad\n\n        Sentence: The fragrant orangutan sings loudest at Easter.\n        Answer: good\n\n        Sentence: In November 1907 , rumors were prevalent that Baird and Fitzpatrick intended to resign unless Michigan withdrew from the conference .\n        Answer:[/INST]", "output": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Sentence: Flosa has often seen Marn.\nAnswer: good\n\nThis sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the present perfect tense correctly, and the subject-verb agreement is proper.\n\n2. Sentence: Chardon sees often Kuru.\nAnswer: bad\n\nThis sentence is not grammatically correct. The verb \"sees\" should be in the present tense to match the present tense of the sentence.\n\n3.
