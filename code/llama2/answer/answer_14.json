Good: This sentence is grammatically correct, with \"Floso\" as the subject and \"has often seen\" as the verb phrase, and \"Marn\" as the object.\n2. Bad: This sentence is not grammatically correct. \"Chardon\" is a noun, and \"sees\" is a verb, but \"often\" should be an adverb modifying the verb, not a noun.\n3. Bad: This sentence is not grammatically correct. \"Bob\" is a proper noun, and \"walk\" is a verb, but it needs a subject to be grammatically correct.\n4. Good: This sentence is grammatically correct, with \"Malevolent floral candy\" as the subject and \"is\" as the verb, and \"delicious\" as an adjective modifying the noun.\n5. Good: This sentence is grammatically correct, with \"The bone\" as the subject and \"chewed\" as the verb, and \"the dog\" as the object.\n6. Bad: This sentence is not grammatically correct. \"The bone\" is a noun, and \"dog\" is a noun, but it needs a verb to be grammatically correct.\n7.
