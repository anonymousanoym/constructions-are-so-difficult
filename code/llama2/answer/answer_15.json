Flosa has often seen Marn: Good - This sentence is grammatically correct, with a subject (Flos) and a verb (has seen) in the present tense.\n2. Chardon sees often Kuru: Bad - This sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb \"sees\" does not agree with the subject \"Chardon\" in number. \"Chardon\" is a singular noun, so the verb should be in the singular form \"sees\" instead of the plural form \"see.\"\n3. Bob walk: Bad - This sentence is not grammatically correct because it is missing a verb. \"Walk\" is a verb, but it needs a subject to be complete.\n4. Malevolent floral candy is delicious: Good - This sentence is grammatically correct, with a subject (malevolent floral candy) and a verb (is) in the present tense.\n5. The bone chewed the dog: Good - This sentence is grammatically correct, with a subject (the bone) and a verb (chewed) in the past tense.\n6. The bone dog the chewed: Bad - This sentence is not grammatically correct because the word order is incorrect. The sentence should read \"The dog chewed the bone\" or \"The bone was chewed", "found_words": ["good"], "answer": "good", "gold": "good"}, {"label": "causal", "test": "<s>[INST]Now we are going to say which sentences are acceptable (i.e., grammatical) and which are not.\n\n        Sentence: Flosa has often seen Marn.\n        Answer: good\n\n        Sentence: Chardon sees often Kuru.\n        Answer: bad\n\n        Sentence: Bob walk.\n        Answer: bad\n\n        Sentence: Malevolent floral candy is delicious.\n        Answer: good\n\n        Sentence: The bone chewed the dog.\n        Answer: good\n\n        Sentence: The bone dog the chewed.\n        Answer: bad\n\n        Sentence: I wonder you ate how much.\n        Answer: bad\n\n        Sentence: The fragrant orangutan sings loudest at Easter.\n        Answer: good\n\n        Sentence: Some of his children were not so resentful that he gave them no special privileges and treated their mothers poorly .\n        Answer:[/INST]", "output": "  Sure, I can help you with that!
