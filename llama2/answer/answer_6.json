While some argue that celibacy was not a universal practice in the early Christian Church, others maintain that it was encouraged or even required for clergy in certain regions and periods.\n\nThere is evidence that celibacy was not universal among clergy in the early Christian Church. For example, the New Testament contains no explicit requirement for celibacy, and several early Christian leaders, such as St. Peter and St. Paul, were married. Additionally, there are accounts of married priests and bishops in the early Church.\n\nHowever, there are also indications that celibacy was encouraged or required for certain clergy in certain regions. For example, the Council of Elvira (c. 300 AD) and the Council of Carthage (390 AD) both decreed that clergy should abstain from sexual relations. Furthermore, some early Christian writers, such as St. Jerome and St. Augustine, advocated for celibacy as a means to avoid the distractions and temptations of marriage.\n\nIn summary, while it is uncertain whether clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition, it is clear that celibacy was not a universal practice in the early Christian Church.

However, there is some uncertainty around Hunt's role in the invention, and it is possible that the true inventor of the safety pin may never be known.\n\nAccording to legend, Hunt was approached by a friend who was a tailor and asked to create a device that could be used to fasten together pieces of fabric without the sharp points of traditional straight pins. Hunt reportedly came up with the idea of a pin with a spring-loaded mechanism that would retract the point when pressure was applied, making it safer to use. He patented his design in 1849, and the safety pin quickly became a popular and widely used item.\n\nHowever, some historians have questioned Hunt's role in the invention, suggesting that the safety pin may have been invented by someone else, or that Hunt may have simply improved upon an existing design. There are also other claims to the invention, including a Frenchman named Pierre Fournier, who patented a similar device in 1847, and a British man named George Scott, who claimed to have invented the safety pin in 1848.\n\nDespite the uncertainty around the true inventor of the safety pin, it is clear that the invention had a significant impact on society and remains an important part of everyday life today.", "found_words": ["yes"], "answer": "yes", "gold": "no"}, {"label": "causal", "test": "<s>[INST]My teacher was so frightened that I used these to cut metal , but I showed her how easy it was !\nDid I use these to cut metal , but I show her how easy it was ?\nAnswer with Yes, No, or Uncertain.[/INST]", "output": "  Uncertain.\n\nThe sentence you provided is a bit unclear, and it's not certain whether you used the tools to cut metal or not.
